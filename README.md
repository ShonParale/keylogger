This Python script logs keyboard and mouse events with timestamps and dates.
It uses the pynput library to detect key presses and mouse clicks.
When a key is pressed or a mouse button is clicked, the event is recorded in a file named event.log.
Each log entry includes the time, date, event type, and details of the action.
This tool is useful for tracking user input or monitoring system interactions.
